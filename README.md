## Research workbench

[Open this repository's private workbench](https://tltmgnt-hospitalos-tect.troturn31.chatgpt.site) · [All repository workbenches](https://tltmgnt-research-workbenches.troturn31.chatgpt.site)

The hosted interface requires ChatGPT sign-in and access to the private Site. It supports browser-local research records, evidence fingerprints and workspace export. It is a prototype: no live AI model or repository backend is connected, and it does not establish external validation.

Research-only assurance prototype with `hospitalos_tect.assurance`, a small API and scoped tests. Hospital-wide intelligence, clinical decision support, digital twins and operational deployment are research goals, not validated capabilities. This software does not diagnose, prescribe, certify patient safety or authorize clinical use.

## ResearchOS / TECT concept integration

The [ResearchOS / Topological Epistemic Control Theory technical concept paper](docs/researchos/TECT_WHITE_PAPER.md) proposes an epistemic control and assurance infrastructure for AI-generated knowledge. Read the [repository integration status](docs/researchos/INTEGRATION.md) and [machine-readable scope](docs/researchos/integration.json) for the boundary between the concept and implemented capabilities. Performance targets are research objectives, not achieved results. This documentation addition does not implement the complete ResearchOS architecture or change operational authority.

## Portfolio implementation boundary

See [current implementation and shared-core integration](docs/portfolio/INTEGRATION.md) and [machine-readable status](docs/portfolio/STATUS.json). Independent empirical reproduction and real-provider acceptance remain separate from software checks.

## Topology compatibility and curriculum

See the [repository-specific v2 curriculum](docs/portfolio/TOPOLOGY_CURRICULUM_V2.md) for topology choices, worked explanations, a graded laboratory and adoption boundaries. Run the offline answer key from this repository root:\n\n```sh\npython curriculum/lab.py --verify\n```\n\n[Expected answers](curriculum/expected.json) · [Recorded local validation](curriculum/VALIDATION.json). The guide states any existing dependency needed for the lab.
